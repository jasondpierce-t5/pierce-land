# Milestone v1.1: Polish & UX

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-10
**Phases:** 9-13
**Total Plans:** 6

## Overview

Elevate admin experience and visual polish to match the professional quality of the public-facing plan pages. This milestone focused entirely on UX improvements — no new features, purely refinement of existing functionality for a more polished, professional feel across all surfaces.

## Phases

### Phase 9: Public Page Design Polish

**Goal**: Refine typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy on public plan pages for a more polished presentation
**Depends on**: Phase 8 (Print Optimization & Deployment)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 09-01: Cover Header & Section Spacing
- [x] 09-02: Tables, Cards & Chart Polish

**Details:**
- Enlarged cover H1 from text-3xl to text-4xl for stronger brand impact
- Increased cover vertical padding (py-10 to py-14) for more breathing room
- Applied shadow-md + ring-1 ring-accent/20 to hero KPI (Annual Net Income) card
- Added border border-gray-100 to 16 content cards for better definition
- Increased chart titles from text-sm to text-base with mb-4 spacing
- Increased TableRow padding from py-2 to py-2.5 for comfortable scanning
- Main content container changed from space-y-8 to space-y-12 for section rhythm

### Phase 10: Print & PDF Polish

**Goal**: Improve print stylesheet for cleaner, more professional banker-ready PDF output
**Depends on**: Phase 9
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 10-01: Print Spacing Compression & Visual Refinement

**Details:**
- Print spacing compressed ~50%: cover padding halved, section gaps 3rem to 1.5rem, card padding tightened
- Print borders strengthened from gray-100 to gray-300 (#d1d5db) for paper visibility
- Heading orphan prevention with break-after: avoid on h2 elements
- Branded "Pierce Land & Cattle" footer via @page @bottom-center
- Zebra striping strengthened to #f0f0f0, accent highlight opacity increased 10% to 18%
- KPI ring artifacts cleanly removed in print context

### Phase 11: Admin Config Form UX

**Goal**: Redesign config form with better grouping, labels, descriptions, and editing flow
**Depends on**: Phase 10
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 11-01: Collapsible Sections, Field Descriptions & Sticky Save Bar

**Details:**
- Created CollapsibleSection component with click-to-toggle accordion behavior
- 8 config sections wrapped in collapsible accordions with section-level descriptions
- First 3 sections default to open (Operator Info, Market Prices, Feed Costs)
- Field-level helper text for 7 jargon fields (LRP Premium, Marketing Commission, etc.)
- Sticky save bar with unsaved changes detection via JSON.stringify comparison
- Amber "Unsaved changes" indicator, disabled "Saved" state, green "Saved!" flash

### Phase 12: Admin Dashboard & Navigation

**Goal**: Improve dashboard landing page, navigation between admin sections, and overall workflow
**Depends on**: Phase 11
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 12-01: Dashboard Live Stats & Breadcrumb Navigation

**Details:**
- Dashboard fetches live version data from API showing active/total counts
- Feature cards converted to Next.js Link components with hover scale effects
- Active versions quick-links with public view and edit links
- Breadcrumb navigation on all admin sub-pages with human-readable labels
- UUID path segments automatically skipped in breadcrumb display
- Loading skeleton placeholders while data fetches

### Phase 13: Bank Version Management UX

**Goal**: Polish the bank version create/edit/list experience for smoother admin workflow
**Depends on**: Phase 12
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 13-01: List Polish, GET-by-ID, Slug Preview URLs

**Details:**
- Bank version list upgraded with skeleton loading, green success banners from URL params
- View Plan links and Reactivate button for inactive versions
- Created date column added to version list
- GET-by-ID API endpoint for efficient single version fetch (edit page no longer fetches all)
- Slug preview URL shown on both create and edit forms (clickable on edit)
- Wrapped useSearchParams in Suspense boundary for Next.js 14 compatibility

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- CSS max-height accordion transition — simpler than JS height measurement, no layout thrashing
- Set-based section tracking — multiple config sections open simultaneously for reference workflow
- JSON.stringify for change detection — simple, reliable for flat config shape
- Inline breadcrumb in layout.tsx — layout-specific, simple enough for single file
- Suspense boundary for useSearchParams — required by Next.js 14 static generation
- All print overrides inside @media print — zero screen-side impact
- Print borders at gray-300 — visible on all printers without being heavy

**Issues Resolved:**

- Suspense boundary needed for useSearchParams (Next.js 14 static page generation)
- Slug preview URL not clickable on edit page (fixed with full anchor wrap)

**Issues Deferred:**

None.

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None — this milestone was purely polish/refinement with no shortcuts taken.
