# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-10
**Phases:** 1-8
**Total Plans:** 16

## Overview

This roadmap takes the project from initial setup through deployment of a professional business plan generator. We start with database foundation, build the admin interface for managing shared financials, add bank version management, implement the calculation engine that drives all projections, create public plan pages, add visual charts, and finish with print optimization and deployment to piercelandandcattle.com.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Database
**Goal**: Next.js project initialized with Supabase connected and database schema deployed
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Project Initialization (Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind + Supabase)
- [x] 01-02: Database Schema Deployment (plan_config and plan_versions tables)

### Phase 2: Admin Authentication & Layout
**Goal**: Protected admin dashboard with navigation structure
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Admin Authentication & Dashboard (middleware, login, layout)

### Phase 3: Shared Config Management
**Goal**: Admin interface to edit market prices, feed costs, weights, ADG, and operational parameters
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Config CRUD Interface (API routes and admin form)

### Phase 4: Bank Version Management
**Goal**: Create, edit, and deactivate bank-specific plans with optional overrides
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Bank Version API (CRUD endpoints, slug generation, validation)
- [x] 04-02: Bank Version Admin UI (list, create, edit forms with slug auto-generation)

### Phase 5: Financial Calculations Engine
**Goal**: Complete calculation logic for all financial projections and sensitivity analysis
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: Schema Migration & Config API Updates (32 new operational fields, 8-section admin form)
- [x] 05-02: Calculation Engine Core (type definitions, mergeConfig, spring/winter turns, annual projections, breakeven)
- [x] 05-03: Scenario & Sensitivity Analysis (scenarios, hay/purchase sensitivity, worst-case)

### Phase 6: Public Plan Pages
**Goal**: Dynamic `/plan/[slug]` routes rendering bank-specific business plans
**Depends on**: Phase 4, Phase 5
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01: Public Data Layer & Page Foundation (formatters, fetchPlanData, /plan/[slug] route, cover header, KPI row)
- [x] 06-02: Financial Detail Sections (operation overview, spring/winter turn tables, annual projections, credit structure)
- [x] 06-03: Analysis Sections & Verification (scenario analysis, breakeven, worst-case, sensitivity tables, disclaimer, human verify)

### Phase 7: Charts & Visualizations
**Goal**: All business charts rendered with Chart.js (scenario, breakeven, cost, sensitivity)
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 07-01: Chart.js Setup + Chart Components (install packages, config, ScenarioChart, BreakevenChart, CostBreakdownChart, HaySensitivityChart, PurchaseSensitivityChart)
- [x] 07-02: Page Integration + Visual Verification (integrate charts into plan page, human verify)

### Phase 8: Print Optimization & Deployment
**Goal**: Print-to-PDF functionality polished, app deployed to piercelandandcattle.com
**Depends on**: Phase 6, Phase 7
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 08-01: Print Optimization (print stylesheet, print button, human verify print quality)
- [x] 08-02: Production Deployment (build verification, Vercel deploy, custom domain piercelandandcattle.com)

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:** None — all phases executed in original order.

**Key Decisions:**
- Browser print-to-PDF vs server-side: Simpler implementation, sufficient quality for v1
- Two-table schema (config + versions): Shared defaults with per-bank overrides
- Simple password auth: Single operator, no team collaboration needs
- Chart.js for visualizations: Lightweight, React-friendly, sufficient for business charts
- Numeric types (not float) for all financial values: Calculation precision
- Pure TypeScript calculation engine: No mutations, no side effects
- Direct server component data fetching (no API routes for public pages)

**Issues Resolved:** None logged — clean execution throughout.

**Issues Deferred:** None.

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Next.js 14.2.21 has a known security vulnerability (flagged during Vercel build) — should upgrade
- useEffect missing dependency warning in admin edit page — minor React hooks issue
- No test coverage — TDD was available but not needed for v1 scope
