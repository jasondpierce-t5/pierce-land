<objective>
Polish the cover header, KPI row, and section structure of the public plan page for a more refined, professional presentation.

Purpose: The plan page is functional but visually flat — all sections carry equal weight, the cover is understated, and spacing is tight. This plan elevates the visual hierarchy so bankers see a premium document.
Output: Enhanced cover header, differentiated KPI row, improved section heading and spacing rhythm.

**Tech stack:** Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, Inter font
**Established patterns:** Utility-first Tailwind, inline helper components (TableRow, SubtotalRow, TotalRow, SectionHeading)
**Constraining decisions:**
- Phase 6: accent border-l-4 pattern for section headings
- Phase 8: Print stylesheet uses letter-size, 0.75in margins, 11pt base — changes must not break print layout
- Phase 8: Only 2 forced page breaks (Spring Turn, Scenario Analysis) — don't add more

**Key principle:** This is polish, not redesign. Refine what exists — don't restructure the page layout or change the data being displayed. Keep all print classes (print-break-before, print-no-break, no-print) exactly where they are.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Enhance cover header for stronger first impression</name>
  <files>src/app/plan/[slug]/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Refine the cover header section (lines ~121-145) with these specific class changes:

1. **Container padding:** Change `py-10 px-8` to `py-14 px-8` for more vertical breathing room
2. **H1 brand name:** Change `text-3xl font-bold tracking-wide` to `text-4xl font-bold tracking-wide` for more impact
3. **Subtitle:** Change `text-xl mt-1 text-white/80` to `text-xl mt-2 font-light text-white/80` — add font-light for elegant contrast against bold h1, slightly more margin
4. **Divider:** Change `my-4` to `my-6` for better separation between brand block and prepared-for line
5. **Operator info line:** Change `mt-2 text-white/70` to `mt-3 text-sm text-white/60` — slightly smaller and more subtle as tertiary info

Do NOT change the "Prepared for" or date text sizes. Do NOT modify any structural layout or data display. Do NOT touch the PrintButton section above the cover.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build passes without errors</verify>
  <done>Cover header has larger H1 (text-4xl), more vertical padding (py-14), better divider spacing (my-6), elegant subtitle weight (font-light), and refined operator info (text-sm, text-white/60)</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Differentiate KPI row and improve section rhythm</name>
  <files>src/app/plan/[slug]/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Three changes:

**A. KPI Row — Emphasize primary metric:**
The first KPI card (Annual Net Income, ~line 152) should stand out as the hero metric. Change its classes:
- Current: `bg-white shadow-sm rounded-lg p-4 border-l-4 border-accent`
- New: `bg-white shadow-md rounded-lg p-4 border-l-4 border-accent ring-1 ring-accent/20`

This adds a subtle ring and elevated shadow to distinguish it. The other 4 KPI cards keep their existing `shadow-sm` styling unchanged.

**B. Section heading spacing:**
Every `<h2>` section heading is followed by content with `mt-4`. Increase that gap to `mt-6` for better breathing room between heading and content. Apply to ALL occurrences of `mt-4` that directly follow an h2 (the bg-white card/table containers). There are approximately 8-9 such instances.

IMPORTANT: Only change `mt-4` on the direct content containers after h2 headings. Do NOT change `mt-4` inside cards (like the grid gap-4 inside annual projections or credit structure). The pattern to look for is: `<h2>` tag followed by `<div className="... mt-4 bg-white ...">` or `<div className="... mt-4 grid ...">`.

**C. Main content area spacing:**
Change `space-y-8` on the main content container (~line 148) to `space-y-12` for more breathing room between major sections.

Do NOT modify any print classes, data values, or table content.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build passes without errors</verify>
  <done>Primary KPI card has elevated shadow+ring treatment, section content has mt-6 gap from headings, main sections have space-y-12 rhythm</done>
