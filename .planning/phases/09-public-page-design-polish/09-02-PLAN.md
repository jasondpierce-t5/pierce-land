<objective>
Polish data display elements — tables, cards, chart titles — and verify the complete visual result.

Purpose: Refine the detailed content sections so financial data is easier to scan and the document feels cohesive from cover to disclaimer.
Output: Polished table rows, enhanced chart titles, refined card borders, banker-verified visual quality.

@src/app/plan/[slug]/page.tsx

**Tech stack:** Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, Inter font
**Prior plan context:** 09-01 enhanced cover header, KPI differentiation, and section spacing
**Constraining decisions:**
- Phase 8: Print stylesheet at 11pt base — avoid adding classes that break print
- Inline helper components (TableRow, SubtotalRow, TotalRow, SectionHeading) are defined at top of file

**Key principle:** Polish, not redesign. Refine existing elements. Don't change data, calculations, or page structure.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Refine tables, cards, and chart presentation</name>
  <files>src/app/plan/[slug]/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Four targeted refinements:

**A. Card border definition:**
Add a subtle border to all content cards for better definition on screen and in print. Every card that currently has `bg-white shadow-sm rounded-lg` should gain `border border-gray-100`. This applies to:
- Spring/Winter turn table containers (`bg-white shadow-sm rounded-lg overflow-hidden`)
- Chart wrapper cards (`bg-white shadow-sm rounded-lg p-6`)
- Operation Overview card
- Scenario Analysis card
- Hay/Purchase sensitivity cards
- Credit Structure card

Pattern: Add `border border-gray-100` alongside existing `shadow-sm rounded-lg` classes. Do NOT add it to the KPI cards (they already have border-l-4) or the Annual Projections inner grid cards (bg-gray-50, not bg-white).

**B. Chart titles — increase prominence:**
All chart title h4 elements currently use `text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-3`. Change to `text-base font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4`. This affects ~5 instances:
- Spring Turn Cost Breakdown
- Winter Turn Cost Breakdown
- Scenario Comparison
- Breakeven vs Market Price
- Hay Price Impact on Winter Net
- Purchase Price Impact on Annual Net

**C. Table helper component refinement:**
Modify the `TableRow` helper component (~line 43-58):
- Change `py-2 px-4` to `py-2.5 px-4` for slightly more vertical breathing room in financial tables

Modify the `SectionHeading` helper component (~line 86-92):
- Change `px-4 py-2` to `px-4 py-2.5` to match the increased row padding

**D. Breakeven cards — add subtle border accent:**
The two breakeven cards (~lines 634-646) currently use `bg-white shadow-sm rounded-lg p-6 text-center`. Change to `bg-white shadow-sm rounded-lg p-6 text-center border border-gray-100`. Also change the breakeven value `text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-1` to `text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-2` for a touch more spacing.

Do NOT modify any print classes, data values, or calculation logic.

  <verify>npm run build passes without errors</verify>
  <done>Cards have border-gray-100, chart titles are text-base with mb-4, table rows have py-2.5, breakeven cards have border treatment</done>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Complete public page design polish — enhanced cover header, differentiated KPI row, improved section spacing, refined table rows, polished card borders, and larger chart titles</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run: npm run dev
    2. Visit: http://localhost:3000/plan/[any-existing-slug] (check your Supabase plan_versions table for a valid slug)
    3. Cover header: Should feel more impactful — larger brand name, more vertical space, elegant subtitle
    4. KPI row: Annual Net Income (first card) should have a slightly more prominent appearance than the other 4 cards
    5. Sections: More breathing room between major sections (12-unit spacing)
    6. Tables: Rows should have comfortable padding, not feel cramped
    7. Cards: Should have subtle borders for better definition
    8. Chart titles: Should be clearly readable (larger than before)
    9. Print test: Use browser print preview (Ctrl+P) — verify no layout breaks, pages still look professional
    10. Overall: Should feel like a premium financial document suitable for banker presentation
